In an undergraduate project, I tackled part of the challenge of teaching robots to perform
motor skills from a small number of
demonstrations. We proposed a novel approach
by joining the theories of Koopman Operators
and Dynamic Movement Primitives to Learning
from Demonstration. Our approach, named Autoencoder Dynamic Mode Decomposition (aDMD),
projects nonlinear dynamical systems into linear
latent spaces such that a solution reproduces the
desired complex motion. Use of an autoencoder in
our approach enables generalizability and scalabil-
ity, while the constraint to a linear system attains
interpretability.
We show results on the LASA Handwriting dataset but with training on
only a small fractions of the letters.
