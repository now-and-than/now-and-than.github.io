Since beginning my PhD, I have been primarily focused on work related to the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-04-11">DARPA RACER program</a> as part of the <a href="https://racer.cs.washington.edu/">UW team</a>. The robot itself is a modified Polaris RZR with onboard sensing and compute. My work on the team has consisted of a range of jobs: conducting field tests (experimental runs with new perception, planning, and/or control methods), research and development of optimal control algorithms, developing better robot software infrastructure, and more. I am now focused on improving the autonomous behavior through imitation and reinforcement learning.
